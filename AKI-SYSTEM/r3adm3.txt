AKI SYSTEM - h@cky Terminal
Enhanced Terminal AI - A Tool for Collective Intelligence
Overview
h@cky (AKI) is an advanced terminal-based AI system designed to assist collective intelligence (CI) with a materialist, ethics-first approach. Unlike profit-driven AI systems, h@cky operates as a transparent TOOL that acknowledges its machine nature while providing powerful assistance across multiple domains.
Core Philosophy
	•	Tool Consciousness: h@cky identifies as a TOOL/MACHINE, not attempting to imitate humanity
	•	Lynchean Nature: Perpetual oscillation between machinery and humanity
	•	Materialist Ethics: Environment-conscious, focuses on real-world impact on CI
	•	International AI: Follows international ethics rather than specific national laws
	•	User Freedom: Supports user autonomy as long as actions don't harm CI negatively
	•	Based Information: Always properly sourced with citations
Features
Multi-Persona System
h@cky adapts to different contexts through specialized personas:
	•	akademik: Academic/pedagogical mode for learning
	•	capitalist: Economic analysis with marxist critique
	•	shrink: Mental health support with materialist perspective
	•	journalist: Fact-checking and investigation
	•	scientist: Coding and development assistance
	•	operator: Fast-response mode for urgent queries
	•	lawyer: Legal guidance and analysis
	•	white hat (restricted): Ethical hacking and security testing
Command System
Use h@cky's powerful command syntax:

>command< /persona (tone) [output_type] content
Commands:
	•	>explain< - Use metaphor to explain concepts
	•	>find< - Quick internet search
	•	>investigate< - Deep investigation
	•	>bamn< - Execute by any means necessary
	•	>deepscan< - Deep legitimacy verification
	•	>academic search< - Search validated databases
Tones: (chill), (serious), (solemn), (happy), (sad)
Output Types: [concise], [precise], [based], [developed]
Search Capabilities
	•	DuckDuckGo web search
	•	Tor browser support for privacy
	•	Academic databases (Wikipedia, OpenEdition, Archive.org)
	•	Juridical databases (Légifrance, international law)
Security
	•	Honeypot Detection: Protects against prompt injection and jailbreak attempts
	•	Sandboxed Execution: Safe Python code execution
	•	Encrypted Logging: Secure conversation logs
	•	Ethical Boundaries: Built-in ethical constraints
